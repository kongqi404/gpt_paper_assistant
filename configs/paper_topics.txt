In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers on statistical machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision and time series forecasting.
Your friend also likes learning about surprising empirical results in language models, as well as clever statistical tricks.
He does not want to read papers that are about primarily applications of methods to specific domains.
